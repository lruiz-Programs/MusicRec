Developed a Python program, musicrecplus.py, to manage user music preferences and provide tailored recommendations. Key features include:

Database Management: Upon startup, the program loads user data from musicrecplus.txt, creating the file if it doesnâ€™t exist. User data is stored in the format UserName: Artist1, Artist2, Artist3,..., with artist names in title case, sorted, and free of duplicates.
User Input: Users are prompted to enter their names. New users input their preferences before accessing the main menu, while returning users go directly to the menu.
Privacy Mode: Users can opt for privacy by appending a $ to their names, which affects how their preferences are handled.
